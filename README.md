# C_3D_Interactive_Polygon_Viewer
3D Interactive Polygon Viewer in C++
In this project, I was asked to set up a 3D interactive polygon viewing using OpenGL functions. 
I should load a 3D polygon defined by a triangular mesh (.OFF format), calling OpenGL functions 
to manipulate the polygon. These include translation, rotation, and scaling, all controlled by 
the left button of the mouse. If the key ‘t’ is hit, then moving the mouse with left button pressed 
will translate the object. Similarly the key ‘r’ and ‘s’ will initiate rotation and scaling if the 
left mouse button is pressed and the mouse moves. Another goal in this project was to create menus 
and invoke associated actions. Source code (C++ & OpenGL) is available in this repository.
